#### Deliver in-app analytics chat
Enable business users to uncover data insights simply by asking questions in a conversational interface,
using the `Chatbot` component.

#### Provide easy quick-start insights
Encourage exploration of the data landscape with AI generated recommended queries,
facilitated by the `useGetQueryRecommendations` hook.

#### Bring insights to life with data storytelling
Enhance collaboration and add context to your data with auto-generated insights through `GetNlgQueryResult` or `useGetNlgQueryResult`.
