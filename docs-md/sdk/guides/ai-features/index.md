# Conversational Analytics with Generative AI  <Badge type="beta" text="Private Beta" />

Compose SDK contains generative AI (GenAI) React components and hooks for creating conversational analytics experiences.

::: warning Note
This feature is currently under private beta for selected customers and is subject to changes as we make fixes and improvements. Weâ€™re excited to work closely with customers who are eager to get hands-on, test, and help shape this game-changing feature.

To be considered for the beta program, please sign up at [www.sisense.com/get/gen-ai-partner](https://www.sisense.com/get/gen-ai-partner/).
:::

The GenAI components and hooks enable you to:

- **Deliver in-app analytics chat**: Enable business users to uncover data insights easily by asking questions in a conversational interface, using the `<Chatbot />` component. Learn more [about the chatbot](./chatbot.md) or see how to [get started using the chatbot](./quickstart.md#chatbot) in your code.
- **Provide easy quickstart insights**: Encourage exploration of the data landscape with AI-generated recommended queries from within the chatbot or with the `useGetQueryRecommendations()` hook. See how to [get started using query recommendations](./quickstart.md#query-recommendations) in your code.
- **Bring insights to life with data storytelling**: Enhance collaboration and add context to your data with auto-generated, natural language insights using the `<GetNlgQueryResult />` component or the `useGetNlgQueryResult()` hook. See how to [get started using natural language insights](./quickstart.md#natural-language-generation-nlg-query-results) in your code.
