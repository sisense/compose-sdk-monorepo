This troubleshooting guide provides possible answers to common issues that may arise when using the Compose SDK GenAI components.

## Component Errors

Here are some common errors that you may encounter.

#### Blank screen with Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module [...] does not provide an export named 'AiContextProvider'

Check that you are importing from `@sisense/sdk-ui/ai` and not `@sisense/sdk-ui`.

#### Error: No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one

Check that your app is wrapped in an `AiContextProvider`.
