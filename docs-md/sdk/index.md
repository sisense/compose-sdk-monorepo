# Compose SDK

Compose SDK is a software development kit that enables a composable, code-driven way to use Sisense platform capabilities. Build analytics and data-driven experiences into your product with code using Compose SDK, a set of client-side libraries and components for query composition, data visualization, and more.

-   **Create Sisense queries, charts, and filters directly from your application code**
    No predefined dashboards or widgets required - or render existing widgets by ID. Mix and match approaches to fit your needs.
-   **Composable, modular and extensible**
    Use our components, customize them, or bring your own. Compose SDK works equally well for building new applications or upgrading existing ones to use Sisenseâ€™s powerful analytics platform.
-   **Built with developer experience in mind**
    The SDK is available via GitHub and NPM, supports TypeScript and React, and includes documentation, code samples and CLI tools that help you get things done with ease.
