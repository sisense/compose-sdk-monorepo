# Compose SDK <Badge type="beta" text="Beta" />

Compose SDK is a software development kit that enables a composable, code-driven way to use Sisense platform capabilities. Build analytics and data-driven experiences into your product with code using Compose SDK, a set of client-side libraries and components for query composition, data visualization, and more.

 - **Create Sisense queries, charts, and filters directly from your application code**
 No predefined dashboards or widgets required - or render existing widgets by ID. Mix and match approaches to fit your needs.
 - **Composable, modular and extensible**
 Use our components, customize them, or bring your own. Compose SDK works equally well for building new applications or upgrading existing ones to use Sisenseâ€™s powerful analytics platform.
 - **Built with developer experience in mind**
 The SDK is available via GitHub and NPM, supports TypeScript and React, and includes documentation, code samples and CLI tools that help you get things done with ease.

::: warning You should know
 - **Compose SDK is currently in Beta** - Packages, APIs, and anything else is bound to change
 - Compose SDK currently supports development using TypeScript & React. Additional frameworks will be supported in the future
 - The [Compose SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/sisense/compose-sdk-monorepo) is a monorepo containing all SDK packages. You can find the individual packages [here](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sisense)

 - Embed visualizations from pre-defined Sisense Widgets
 - Create interactive data exploration with Filter components
