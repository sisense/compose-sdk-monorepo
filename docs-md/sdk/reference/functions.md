### Everything aggregative

The Analytical Engine requires that every measure defined in a formula be aggregative. For example, instead of `DDiff([Discharge Time], [Admission Time])`, use `AVG(DDiff([Discharge Time], [Admission Time]))`.

### Multi-pass

All aggregative functions can be run by themselves or as part of a multi-pass aggregation. The multi-pass version of an aggregative function in essence runs an aggregation on a function (instead of a value) and groups the results.

Multi-pass aggregations take the following form, where `INNER` is a function, `<group_by_field>` is the field to group the inner function's results by, and `OUTER` is an aggregation over the inner function's grouped results:

```
OUTER(<group_by_field>, INNER(<field>))
```

This concept is a bit easier to understand after seeing it in practice, so let's take a look how you might calculate something like the average total revenue per product.

Consider the following multi-pass call:

```
AVG([Product], SUM(Revenue));
```

This call calculates the average total revenue per product. It does so by calculating the total revenue per product and then taking the average of all those totals.

### Date resolution

Datetime fields within queries can be resolved at a number of levels. For the purpose of the functions in this reference, you can resolve the dates in your queries to years, quarters, months, weeks, or days.

The active date resolution of a query is determined by the minimum date level of the date dimension used for presentation and filtering.

For example, suppose you have a data model containing data for 2 complete years.

If you query that model for total cost and you resolve a date in the query to years, you receive the total cost for each of the 2 years.

| Year in Date | Total Cost    |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 2022         | 33,705,906.25 |
| 2023         | 37,722,696.58 |

However, if you query that same data model for total cost and you resolve a date to quarters, you receive the total cost for each of the 8 quarters in the 2 years.

| Quarter in Date |   Total Cost |
| --------------- | -----------: |
| 2022 Q1         | 6,970,893.27 |
| 2022 Q2         | 7,549,119.55 |
| 2022 Q3         | 8,136,195.73 |
| 2022 Q4         | 11,049,697.6 |
| 2023 Q1         |  8,594,218.7 |
| 2023 Q2         | 9,408,611.73 |
| 2023 Q3         | 10,169,728.6 |
| 2023 Q4         | 9,550,137.52 |

The resolution of datetime fields also affects how time-related functions are calculated.

As an example, let's use the same data model with 2 complete years of data to examine how the date resolution of a query affects the `DIFFPASTYEAR()` function, which calculates the difference between the current year's data and the previous year's data.

If you query that model for the `DIFFPASTYEAR(SUM([COST]))` and you resolve a date in the query to years, you receive the cost of the previous year for each of the 2 years and the difference in cost from the first year to the second year.

| Year in Date | Total Cost    | Difference in Cost |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 2022         | 33,705,906.25 |                    |
| 2023         | 37,722,696.58 | 4,016,790.33       |

However, if you query that same data model for difference in total cost and you resolve that date to quarters, you receive the total cost for each of the 8 quarters in the 2 years and the difference in cost between quarters. Notice how the difference in cost is calculated based on the same quarter in the previous year. So the difference in total cost for 2023 Q3 is the difference when compared to the total cost of 2022 Q3.

| Year in Date | Total Cost    | Difference in Cost |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 2022 Q1      | 6,970,893.27  |                    |
| 2022 Q2      | 7,549,119.55  |                    |
| 2022 Q3      | 8,136,195.73  |                    |
| 2022 Q4      | 11,049,697.69 |                    |
| 2023 Q1      | 8,594,218.7   | 1,623,325.44       |
| 2023 Q2      | 9,408,611.73  | 1,859,492.17       |
| 2023 Q3      | 10,169,728.63 | 2,033,532.90       |
| 2023 Q4      | 9,550,137.52  | -1,499,560.17      |

By default, `RSUM` accumulates a measure by the sorting order of the query's dimension. To accumulate by another order, add the relevant measure to the query and by that measure.

You can specify a boolean value to indicate whether to accumulate the sum continuously when there are two or more dimensions. By default, the sum is not accumulated continuously.

##### Syntax (`RSUM`)

```
RSUM(<numeric_field>, [<continuous>])
```

- `numeric_field`: Field to calculate the running sum for.
- `continuous`: Optional. A boolean value that determines whether to accumulate the sum continuously when there are two or more dimensions. Defaults to `FALSE`.

##### Example (`RSUM`)

Get the running total of the total revenue.

```
RSUM([Total Revenue])
```

```

---

#### R Double (`RDOUBLE`)

Returns a numeric result for a given R expression and a list of numeric values. The R expression is passed to the running Rserve.

Syntax:

```
RDOUBLE(<R expression>, [<ordering>], <numeric value 1>, [<numeric value 2>, ..., <numeric value n>])
RDOUBLE(<recycle>, <R expression>, [<ordering>], <numeric value 1>, [<numeric value 2>, ..., <numeric value n>])
```

Arguments:

- `<R expression>`: Your R code, wrapped in double quotes. R expects the return type to be an array with the same size as the query's row count. Nulls will be used to make up for shorter arrays, and longer arrays will be trimmed. Use single quotes to wrap strings within your R code, so that there will be no double-quote collision with the quotes wrapping your R code.
- `<Numeric Field>`: Numeric values can be passed as arguments to your R code. All arguments are passed to R as a 1-based list named `args`. Each item in the list contains an array that represents the field. For example:
  - `args[[1]]` returns an array which represents the first field that was used as an argument
  - `args[[2]][3]` returns the 3rd data value within the 2nd field that was used as an argument
- `<Ordering>`: Optional. Defines the sort order in which numeric data is sent to R. The argument of the Ordering parameter can be an index in your data source or you can use the [`ORDERING()`](#ordering-ordering) function to determine the order of your fields. This function arranges the values of the arguments into ascending or descending order, breaking ties by further arguments. For example: `ORDERING([Total Sales], -1*[COUNT Salesman], MIN(<Office Name>))`
- `<recycle>`: Optional. Controls whether the results from R should be recycled (cached), so that consequent queries will not have to be recalculated unless they or the data have changed. Generally, behavior is automatically managed by the ElastiCube automatically. However, since R code might have non-deterministic components to it (such as randomality functions or date-specific functions), the ElastiCube cannot rely on a data set and function that has not changed not to return a different result in multiple executions.
  - `TRUE`: Default. Results will be cached for unchanged functions and data.
  - `FALSE`: Results will not be cached. Use this option if your R code contains randomality or other non-deterministic content.

##### Example (RDOUBLE)

Returns the k-means cluster (R expression) of the total cost and total revenue.

```
RDOUBLE("m <-log(matrix(unlist(args), ncol=2)); kmeans (m,3)$cluster", [Total Cost], [Total Revenue])
```

RINT(<recycle>, <R expression>, [<ordering>], <numeric value 1>, [<numeric value 2>, ..., <numeric value n>])
```
