### SDK Shared UI Components

The SDK Shared UI is a library of internal React components designed to streamline development for frontend developers, primarily focused on use in CSDK-related projects.
The goal is to save developers' time by promoting reuse of existing work, enabling faster feature development, quicker bug resolution, and greater consistency across projects.

### Status of SDK shared UI Components

ðŸš§ In Progress

### Steps for Adding New Components

Follow the Existing Structure: Ensure that the new component follows the same structure and conventions as the existing components in the library.

Unit Tests: Provide unit tests for the new component to ensure it functions correctly.

Storybook Stories: Add Storybook stories for the new component to enable visual testing and documentation.

Update `package.json` (Export Configuration): Add the new component to the export configuration in the package.json file located in the root of the package.

Update `typesVersions` Configuration: Include the new component type in the typesVersions configuration in the `package.json` file located in the root of the package.

### Usage

To use the sdk-shared-ui in your React components import the components you need from the library:

```tsx
// Named import example
import { DEPRECATED_Icon } from '@ethings-os/sdk-shared-ui';

const App = () => {
  return <DEPRECATED_Icon {...props} />;
};

export default App;
```

```tsx
// Default import example from subpath
import DEPRECATED_Icon from '@ethings-os/sdk-shared-ui/DEPRECATED_Icon';

const App = () => {
  return <DEPRECATED_Icon {...props} />;
};

export default App;
```
